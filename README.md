- About the name:

  - (Web Wide) World​

      This parsing describes our core architectural and philosophical ​vision.
      - ​Meaning: It signifies a ​decentralized world built to be pervasive across the entire web. It is not just a state of being but an ​invitation and a framework: it anticipates permeating and covering the entire network, advocating that every website and service should interoperate, associate, and adapt itself to become a part of this world.
      - ​Focus: ​A Decentralized Fabric. The emphasis is on creating a cohesive experience through a distributed, open architecture, not a centralized platform.

  - Web (Wide World)​​

      This parsing emphasizes the ​richness of the user experience​ within that architecture.
      - ​Meaning: It describes the ​immense and diverse digital universe​ that emerges within this networked world—a universe of endless experiences, services, and communities that the framework enables.
      - Focus: ​The User's Reality. It highlights the boundless exploration and interaction that users experience within the Web Wide World.

  - Together, these two interpretations form the complete ethos of this project: ​to provide a decentralized protocol that enables a vast digital world to emerge organically across the entire web, inviting every node to participate and every user to explore.​​

- Description:

  Building blocks for constructing a tangible virtual world has begun to take shape. Technologies from various fields are becoming increasingly mature, such as gaming, social platforms, digital twins, and virtual reality.
This session aims to trigger the discussion on how each stakeholder may collaborate to co-create a tangible virtual world that is interconnected, mutually beneficial, supportive and belongs to all. We need a set of standards that enable the integration of individual efforts to build an open platform on web, fostering prosperity through cooperation rather than competition.
This session will delve into our recent endeavors in crafting virtual world experiences on Tencent products. We will share insights from our development process, highlight the innovative solutions we implemented, and discuss the hurdles we encountered along the way.

- The following aspects will be addressed:

  1. Types and Corresponding Roles: Sites as Service Integrators and Programs as Service Providers
  2. Scoping: Defining the Origins of Assets and Elements
  3. Asset Deployments: Planning Asset URIs and Deploying according to Scoping
  4. Site Hierarchy: Inter-Site Integration through Contracts and Administration according to Scoping
  5. Site-Program Integration: Cooperating between Programs and Sites through Contracts
  6. Permission Controls: Managing Authorization for Assets and Elements across Sites/Programs
  7. Version Management: Independent Releases by Sites/Programs with Unified Synchronization across the Virtual World
  8. Multi-user Interaction: Distributed across Sites and Seamlessly Integrated through On-Demand Pub/Sub for Users

- Goal(s):

  1) Call for participation: co-create one tangible virtual world that is globally shared, co-constructed, and interconnected on web.
  2) Share ideas on user experience, economic models, technological challenges.
  3) Discuss standard needs for asset, logic, user interaction, UI and business integrations.
