  Building blocks for constructing a tangible virtual world has begun to take shape. Technologies from various fields are becoming increasingly mature, such as gaming, social platforms, digital twins, and virtual reality.
This session aims to trigger the discussion on how each stakeholder may collaborate to co-create a tangible virtual world that is interconnected, mutually beneficial, supportive and belongs to all. We need a set of standards that enable the integration of individual efforts to build an open platform on web, fostering prosperity through cooperation rather than competition.
This session will delve into our recent endeavors in crafting virtual world experiences on Tencent products. We will share insights from our development process, highlight the innovative solutions we implemented, and discuss the hurdles we encountered along the way.
